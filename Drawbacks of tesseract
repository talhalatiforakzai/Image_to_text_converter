Tesseract requires very clean segmentation of the foreground text from the background
Tesseract doesn’t perform good on images with background noise
Tesseract performs poorly on low resolution images
Characters in the input image cannot appear “pixelated” after segmentation if they do tesseract wont detect them
Certain fonts are accepted more than others by tesseract
Font sizes also make a difference with the smaller and larger fonts being less accurate. The more common font sizes (10-14) make the OCR perform at its best.
